Step 2: Eliminate the First Term of Row 2
To eliminate the

Let’s carefully progress through the matrix steps to solve the system without dividing.

Starting Augmented Matrix:

Step 1: Eliminate 
−
6
𝑥
1
−6x 
1
​
  in Row 2
To eliminate 
−
6
𝑥
1
−6x 
1
​
 , multiply Row 1 by 
3
3 and add it to Row 2:

𝑅

𝑅

+
3
⋅
𝑅

R

​
 →R

​
 +3⋅R

​
 
Performing the row operation:

New Row 2: 
−
6
+
3
(
2
)
=
0
,
3
+

(

)
=

,
𝑘

ℎ
=

ℎ
.
New Row 2:  
−6+3(2)
3+3(1)
k+3h
​
  
=0,
=6,
=k+3h.
​
 
The updated matrix is:

[
2

ℎ

6
𝑘
+

]
[ 
2

​

​

k+3h
​
 ]
Step 2: Analyze Consistency
The second row corresponds to the equation:

6
𝑥
2
=
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
6x 
2
​
 =k+3h
Case 1: 
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
=
0
k+3h=0
If 
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
=
0
k+3h=0, then:

6
𝑥
2
=
0
  
⟹
  
𝑥
2
=
0
6x 
2
​
 =0⟹x 
2
​
 =0
The system is consistent.

Case 2: 
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
≠
0
k+3h

=0
If 
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
≠
0
k+3h

=0, then:

6
𝑥
2
=
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
6x 
2
​
 =k+3h
This means 
𝑥
2
x 
2
​
  exists and can be solved, so the system is still consistent.

Final Answer:
The system is consistent for all values of 
ℎ
h and 
𝑘
k because there is no contradiction at any step.
