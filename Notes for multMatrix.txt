Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, combining two matrices to produce a new matrix. This operation is widely used in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, and economics.

Conditions for Matrix Multiplication:

Dimensions: To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. If matrix A is of size 
𝑚
×
𝑛
m×n and matrix B is of size 
𝑛
×
𝑝
n×p, their product, matrix C, will be of size 
𝑚
×
𝑝
m×p.
How to Multiply Matrices:

Element Calculation: The element in the 
𝑖
i-th row and 
𝑗
j-th column of the resulting matrix C is calculated by taking the dot product of the 
𝑖
i-th row of matrix A and the 
𝑗
j-th column of matrix B.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:

𝑐
𝑖
𝑗
=
∑
𝑘
=
1
𝑛
𝑎
𝑖
𝑘
×
𝑏
𝑘
𝑗
c 
ij
​
 =∑ 
k=1
n
​
 a 
ik
​
 ×b 
kj
​
 

Where 
𝑐
𝑖
𝑗
c 
ij
​
  is the element in the 
𝑖
i-th row and 
𝑗
j-th column of matrix C, 
𝑎
𝑖
𝑘
a 
ik
​
  is the element in the 
𝑖
i-th row and 
𝑘
k-th column of matrix A, and 
𝑏
𝑘
𝑗
b 
kj
​
  is the element in the 
𝑘
k-th row and 
𝑗
j-th column of matrix B.

Example:

Consider the following matrices A and B:

𝐴
=
(
1
2
3
4
5
6
)
A=( 
1
4
​
  
2
5
​
  
3
6
​
 )

𝐵
=
(
7
8
9
10
11
12
)
B= 
​
  
7
9
11
​
  
8
10
12
​
  
​
 

Matrix A is of size 
2
×
3
2×3, and matrix B is of size 
3
×
2
3×2. Their product, matrix C, will be of size 
2
×
2
2×2.

To find the element in the first row and first column of C (
𝑐
11
c 
11
​
 ):

𝑐
11
=
(
1
×
7
)
+
(
2
×
9
)
+
(
3
×
11
)
=
7
+
18
+
33
=
58
c 
11
​
 =(1×7)+(2×9)+(3×11)=7+18+33=58

Similarly, for the first row and second column (
𝑐
12
c 
12
​
 ):

𝑐
12
=
(
1
×
8
)
+
(
2
×
10
)
+
(
3
×
12
)
=
8
+
20
+
36
=
64
c 
12
​
 =(1×8)+(2×10)+(3×12)=8+20+36=64

Continuing this process for all elements, we get:

𝐶
=
(
58
64
139
154
)
C=( 
58
139
​
  
64
154
​
 )

Key Properties of Matrix Multiplication:

Associativity: 
𝐴
(
𝐵
𝐶
)
=
(
𝐴
𝐵
)
𝐶
A(BC)=(AB)C

Distributivity: 
𝐴
(
𝐵
+
𝐶
)
=
𝐴
𝐵
+
𝐴
𝐶
A(B+C)=AB+AC

Non-Commutativity: In general, 
𝐴
𝐵
≠
𝐵
𝐴
AB

=BA
