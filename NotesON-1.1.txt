We want to eliminate the 
−
6
−6 in the first column of Row 2.

Step 1: Multiply Row 1 by a Constant
To match the magnitude of the 
−
6
−6 in Row 2, multiply Row 1 by 
3
3, as 
3
×
2
=
6
3×2=6. The scaled Row 1 becomes:

3
⋅
𝑅
1
=
[
6
3
3
ℎ
]
3⋅R 
1
​
 =[633h]
Step 2: Add the Scaled Row 1 to Row 2
To eliminate 
−
6
−6 in Row 2, add the scaled Row 1 to Row 2 (
𝑅
2
→
𝑅
2
+
3
⋅
𝑅

R

​
 →R

​
 +3⋅R

​
 ).

Perform the operation for each element in Row 2:

First column: 
−
6
+
6
=
0
−6+6=0
Second column: 
3
+
3
=
6
3+3=6
Augmented column: 
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
k+3h
The updated matrix is:

[

𝑘
+

[

​
 ]
Step 3: Analyze Consistency
The second row now corresponds to:

6
𝑥
2
=
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
6x 
2
​
 =k+3h
Consistency Conditions:
If 
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
=
0
k+3h=0:

The second row becomes 
6
𝑥
2
=
0
6x 
2
​
 =0, so 
𝑥
2
=
0
x 
2
​
 =0.
The system is consistent.
If 
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
≠
0
k+3h

=0:

The second row is valid and gives a solution for 
𝑥
2
=
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
6
x 
2
​
 = 
6
k+3h
​
 .
The system is still consistent because there is no contradiction.
Why Add, Not Subtract?
When eliminating terms, the goal is to cancel out the target value (in this case, 
−
6
−6) by creating a value with the opposite sign. Since the scaled Row 1 gives 
6
6 in the first column, we add it to 
−
6
−6 in Row 2:

−
6
+
6
=
0
−6+6=0
Final Answer
The updated matrix is:

[
2
1
ℎ
0
6
𝑘
+
3
ℎ
]
[ 
2
0
​
  
1
6
​
  
h
k+3h
​
 ]
The system is consistent for all values of 
ℎ
h and 
𝑘
k because it always produces a valid solution.
